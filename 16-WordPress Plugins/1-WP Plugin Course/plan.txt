1) What is the problem I am trying to solve?

I'd like to build a list of subscribers on my website. Currently there are lots of plugins that can do this that require a third party service like MailChimp. I don't want to have to rely on MailChimp. The problem is there aren't any WordPress plugins, at least that I know of, that allow me to capture and store subscribers independently of a third party service. I'd also like to reward subscribers with a reward when they opt-in, I can't find a plugin that does that either.
